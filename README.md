# crypto-utils
Python classes to calculate Groups and Elliptic curves. Elliptic curves can also show the steps for point additions if you want. I made these python classes  to check my answers while making the exercises. I figured other people might also find it helpful for practicing and sharing is caring. I ran this in python 3.10 but other version will probably also work.
